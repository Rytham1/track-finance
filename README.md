# track-finance

This is a simple finance tracking project which uses FastAPI, React, and Sqlite.

*Important, I did follow a youtube tutorial, and did google a lot of things, but I now have a deeper understanding on how to host a full stack application using FastAPI. I had no experince w/ this, just knew a little react but learned this for AggieWorks to show my dedication, I can explain the code aswell*

You currently record your purchases, but I have plans to enhance it in the future by adding features that will assist you in better managing your finances. One of these improvements will include displaying the total amount in the top-right corner of the page

1.) Clone the repository
2.) Tools you need installed:
- FastAPI, Uvicorn, sqlachemy, NodeJS


3.) CD into React folder, and * npm start * to run the code
